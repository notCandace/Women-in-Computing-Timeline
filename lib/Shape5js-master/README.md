# Shape5.js
Shape5.js is a wrapper for [P5.js](https://www.p5js.org). You can try out the Shape5.js library [here](https://editor.p5js.org/patrick/sketches/ByAcAtJ6X). The idea behind is project is to reduce the learning curve for making static art with P5.

## Shapes
The following shapes are available in Shape5.js. Please pay attention to the spelling and capitalization of each shape. See the Attributes section for a more detailed look at each shape.

* Circle();
* Square();
* Triangle();
* Polygon();
* Oval();
* Rectangle();
* Semicircle();
* Rhombus();
* RightTriangle();
* IsoscelesTriangle();
* Stripe();

## Syntax
The pattern for creating a shape is to declare a variable, instantiate a shape with the variable, modify the shape, and finally draw the shape.

### Vocabulary Selection
To avoid overloading P5 keywords, words like `spin`, `show`, and `stripe` are used instead of `rotate`, `draw`, and `line`. This was a conscious decision so that users will not think that the workings of Shapes.js are in alignment with P5.js. For example, the `rotate` command in P5.js rotates the contents of the `draw` function around the origin point. Shape5.js, however does not want to have to introduce users to `push`, `translate`, and `pop` in order to rotate a shape. In addition, users do not need to understand radians, they can express all rotations in terms of degrees.

### Shape Variable
The shape variable can be global or local to the `draw` function. Global variables may help to reinforce more traditional coding practices. Using the global variable method is not necessary. It may prove to be more confusing for first-time coders since the shape must be instantiated in the `setup` function. Shape variables can also be declared and instantiated in a single line of code directly in the `draw` function. 

### Instantiating the Shape
If you are using the global variable method, then the shapes must be instantiated in the `setup` function. P5 will not allow you to instantiate the shape before the `setup` function. If you are doing all of the coding in the `draw` function, then creating the variable and instantiating the shape can happen in one line of code.

### Modifying the Shape
How a shape can be modified is dependent upon the attributes associated with each shape. All shapes share a limited set of attributes. See the Attributes section below for a complete list of attributes for each shape. By default, Shape5.js uses CSS colors. Users can also use the traditional `color` command as outlined by the [P5 documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color). Modifications for shapes should come before it is drawn to the canvas. Below is the pattern for changing an attribute. See the example section for more detail.

`variable_name.attribute = value;`

### Drawing the Shape
Each shape has a `.show()` method. Use this to draw the shape to the canvas.

### Example Shape - Global Variable
~~~javascript
let box;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  box = new Square();
}

function draw() {
  background('black');
  
  box.x = 150;
  box.y = 300;
  box.size = 75;
  box.color = 'papayawhip';
  box.spin = 45;
  box.show();
}
~~~

### Example Shape - Local Variable
~~~javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background('black');
  
  let box = new Square();
  box.x = 150;
  box.y = 300;
  box.size = 75;
  box.color = 'papayawhip';
  box.spin = 45;
  box.show();
}
~~~
